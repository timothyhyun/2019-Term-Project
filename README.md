# 2019 Term-Project

• Developed an online student-teach gradebook that received, processed and stored student and teacher
data using Java and Go.
• Provided an intuitive graphical user interface allowing teachers to easily enter student grades and
students to view such grades.
• Created a secure log-in system to ensure the confidentiality of the data.
• Gave easy access to student and teacher data from any device through an Internet-capable Raspberry Pi.

At each login, program gathers data from server and creates the java class structure. This involves converting and parsing JSON strings and displaying it appropriately using JavaFx. During the session, the java structure is updated with any changes while also sending back any changes to the server. At logout, the class structure is completely dissolved.
